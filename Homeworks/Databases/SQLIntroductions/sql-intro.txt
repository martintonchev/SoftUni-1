1. SQL language definition - Stands for "Structured Query Language," and can be pronounced as either "sequel" or "S-Q-L." It is a query language used for accessing and modifying information in a database. Some common SQL commands include "insert," "update," and "delete." The language was first created by IBM in 1975 and was called SEQUEL for "Structured English Query Language." Since then, it has undergone a number of changes, many coming from Oracle products.

Today, SQL is commonly used for Web database development and management. Though SQL is now considered to be a standard language, there are still a number of variations of it, such as mSQL and mySQL. By using a scripting language like PHP, SQL commands can be executed when a Web page loads. This makes it possible to create dynamic Web pages that can display different information each time they load.

3. DML definition - A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of computer languages including commands permitting users to manipulate data in a database. This manipulation involves inserting data into database tables, retrieving existing data, deleting data from existing tables and modifying existing data. DML is mostly incorporated in SQL databases.DML resembles simple English language and enhances efficient user interaction with the system. The functional capability of DML is organized in manipulation commands like SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT INTO and DELETE FROM, as described below:

SELECT: This command is used to retrieve rows from a table. The syntax is SELECT [column name(s)] from [table name] where [conditions]. SELECT is the most widely used DML command in SQL.

UPDATE: This command modifies data of one or more records. An update command syntax is UPDATE [table name] SET [column name = value] where [condition].

INSERT: This command adds one or more records to a database table. The insert command syntax is INSERT INTO [table name] [column(s)] VALUES [value(s)].

DELETE: This command removes one or more records from a table according to specified conditions. Delete command syntax is DELETE FROM [table name] where [condition].

4. DDL - A data definition language (DDL) is a computer language used to create and modify the structure of database objects in a database. These database objects include views, schemas, tables, indexes, etc. 

This term is also known as data description language in some contexts, as it describes the fields and records in a database table.
The present database industry incorporates DDL into any formal language describing data. However, it is considered to be a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL often uses imperative verbs with normal English such as sentences to implement database modifications. Hence, DDL does not show up as a different language in an SQL database, but does define changes in the database schema. 

Commonly used DDL in SQL querying are:


CREATE: This command builds a new table and has a predefined syntax. The CREATE statement syntax is CREATE TABLE [table name] ([column definitions]) [table parameters]. 
CREATE TABLE Employee (Employee Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, First name CHAR (50) NULL, Last name CHAR (75) NOT NULL).
ALTER: An alter command modifies an existing database table. This command can add up additional column, drop existing columns and even change the data type of columns involved in a database table. An alter command syntax is ALTER object type object name parameters. ALTER TABLE Employee ADD DOB Date.
DROP: A drop command deletes a table, index or view. Drop statement syntax is DROP object type object name. DROP TABLE Employee.
